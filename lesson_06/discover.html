                <p><b>Ottawa Parliament Hill, which houses the Prime Minister and the Senate</b>
                Three Gothic Revival-style buildings, located on a 170-foot bluff overlooking the Ottawa River, house the 
                offices of the members of Parliament, the House of Commons and the Senate. Free guided tours delve into Canadian 
                history and explain the workings of the political system.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><b>British Monarchy</b><br>
                In 1858, Queen Victoria selected Ottawa as the capital of the Province of Canada. Barrack Hill was chosen as the site for the new parliament buildings, 
                given its prominence over both the town and the river, as well as the fact that it was already owned by the Crown On 7 May 1859, the Department of 
                Public Works issued a call for design proposals for the new parliament buildings to be erected on Barrack Hill, which was answered with 298 
                submitted drawings. The entries were narrowed down to 3, but the panel of judges could not decide on whose design came first or second. 
                <br><br>Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head was approached to break the stalemate, and the winners were announced on 29 August 1859.
                In 1857, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the common capital for the Province of Canada. Through the 1850s, large sawmills were constructed, 
                followed by rail lines. Public transportation grew quickly. In the 1990s, Ottawa had substantial growth in the high-tech industry, fueling 
                further growth in the city's economy and population.<br><br>

                Originally a trading and lumbering community that grew into a town of regional significance, Ottawa was named the capital of the Province 
                of Canada in 1857 and retained that status when Canada became a dominion within the British Commonwealth in 1867. 
                <br><br>Since the 1980s, about three-quarters of the city's growth has been attributed to relocation from other cities, as well as foreign immigration. 
                The Ottawa metropolitan area has now outpaced the national average growth rate for more than 7 years.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <p><br><b>Population distribution by age</b><br>
                Ottawa population in 2022 is estimated to be 1.18 million, covers city area of 2,790.30 sq km (1,077.34 sq mi), fourth largest city in Canada. <br><br>According
                to statcan data Ottawa population in 2020 estimates are 1,111,773 people. Ottawa refers from Ottawa River, from the Algonquin
                language Odawa, means trade.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <p><b>Ottawa City Size and Density</b>
                The city proper has a population density of 317 people per square kilometer (820/sq mi). The city covers a total surface area of 2,778.13 kilometers squared
                (1,072.9 square miles).

                <p><b>Ottawa Parliament Tours</b>
                <br>Take a free guided tour of the home of Canada's federal government, one of Ottawa's top attractions. 
                Admire historic paintings, as well as architecture decorated with Canadian motifs, in these official spaces.
                <br>The historic, neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings hold pride of place on a hill overlooking the Ottawa River in 
                Canada's capital. Come see where the country's parliamentarians carry out the nation's business. 
                While the Centre Block is closed for renovations, the House of Commons is meeting in a beautiful glass-roofed former 
                courtyard in the West Block, and the Senate is deliberating in a grand Beaux-Arts-style building—originally
                a train station—just one block from Parliament Hill. 
                
                <br><br>In summer, you can also visit the East Block to see 
                historic spaces that have been restored to resemble the way they looked in the late 1800s.
                You can reserve your tickets online if you'd like to take a free tour. Or just drop by “the Hill” for one of
                the free concerts, multimedia shows and other events that take place on the grounds throughout the year.
                
                <br><br>A concentrated cluster of grand government buildings overlooking the Ottawa River, Parliament Hill is the 
                centerpiece of Downtown Ottawa. 
                
                <br><br>At the heart of the complex is Centre Block, a neo-Gothic riot of greening 
                copper turrets, stone-carved gargoyles, and pointed arches built around a soaring central campanile (bell tower) 
                known as the Peace Tower. <br><br>Parliament Hill is not just a pretty sight; it’s also home to Canada’s most important 
                democratic institutions, including the Library of Parliament and the chambers of the House of Commons and the Senate.</p>

                <b>Where is Ottawa?</b><br>
                Ottawa City is located in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, West Canada. The city has coastal location at 
                Eastern Pacific Ocean. The city was first time explored by the British Captain George Ottawa, and hence the name 
                of city has been given after explorer's name.
                
                <br><br>Ottawa lies in northeast of North America, in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Interestingly, it is originally 
                known as 'Ville-Marie', or 'City of Mary'; however, the present name of city is derived from Mont-Royal. 
                The official language of the city is French. It is the second largest French speaking city in the world after Paris. 
                Surprisingly, Montreal has been consistently maintaining good position in the list of world's most livable cities. 
                
                <br><br>It is also known as "Canada's Cultural Capital" given by Monocle Magazine. Furthermore, it is also named as 'UNESCO City of Design'.
                Moreover, at present, Montreal is the center of aerospace, finance, business, commerce, pharmaceuticals, technology, culture, 
                film, and tourism. 
                
                <br><br>As per the report given by 2009 preliminary rankings of the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA), 
                <br><br>Montreal was named as number one host city for international association events of North America.<br><br>
                <hr><br><b>Ottawa History and Demographics</b><br>
                Ottawa, city, capital of Canada, located in southeastern Ontario. In the eastern extreme of the province, Ottawa is situated on
                the south bank of the Ottawa River across from Gatineau, Quebec, at the confluence of the Ottawa (Outaouais), Gatineau, and Rideau rivers. 
                
                <br><br>The Ottawa River (some 790 miles [1,270 km] long), the principal tributary of the St. Lawrence River, was a key factor in the city’s 
                settlement and development; its watershed, covering more than 57,000 square miles (148,000 square km), facilitated the transport of 
                resources such as furs, timber, and minerals from the region. <br><br>The river’s Chaudière Falls, just west of the Rideau Canal, while initially 
                a navigational hazard for the fur trade and later for the transport of logging rafts, ultimately proved to be an asset in the production
                of hydroelectric power for the city and a boon to the growth of industry.<br>
                <br>The first settlement was created in 1800 across from Ottawa in Hull by a New Englander named 'Philemon Wright'. The community, 
                called Wrightsville, became a pioneer in the Ottawa Valley timber trade.<br>
                <br>Bytown (later Ottawa) was founded in 1826 due to work being done on the Rideau Canal. Barracks and a town were set up, and 
                the population reached 1,000 as the Canal was being finished in 1832. 
                <br><br>It was renamed Ottawa in 1855 and incorporated as a city.<br><br><hr><br>
                <b>Languages</b><br>English and French. Ottawa is one of the most bilingual cities in the country. Area, 1,077 square miles (2,790 square km); Ottawa-Gatineau metro. 
                area, 2,427 square miles (6,287 square km). Pop. (2011) 883,391; Ottawa-Gatineau metro. area, 1,254,919; (2021) 1,017,449; Ottawa-Gatineau metro. area, 1,488,307.<br><br>
