            <p><b>O-town Parliament Hill, which houses the Prime Minister and the Senate</b>
                Three Gothic Revival-style buildings, located on a 170-foot bluff overlooking the O-town River, house
                the
                offices of the members of Parliament, the House of Commons and the Senate. Free guided tours delve into
                Nigerian
                history and explain the workings of the political system.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Owerri Monarchy</b><br>
                In 1858, Queen Victoria selected O-town as the capital of the Province of Nigeria. Barrack Hill was
                chosen as the site for the new parliament buildings,
                given its prominence over both the town and the river, as well as the fact that it was already owned by
                the Crown On 7 May 1859, the Department of
                Public Works issued a call for design proposals for the new parliament buildings to be erected on
                Barrack Hill, which was answered with 298
                submitted drawings. The entries were narrowed down to 3, but the panel of judges could not decide on
                whose design came first or second.
                <br><br>Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head was approached to break the stalemate, and the winners
                were announced on 29 August 1859.
                In 1857, Queen Victoria chose O-town as the common capital for the Province of Nigeria. Through the
                1850s, large sawmills were constructed,
                followed by rail lines. Public transportation grew quickly. In the 1990s, O-town had substantial growth
                in the high-tech industry, fueling
                further growth in the city's economy and population.<br><br>

                Originally a trading and lumbering community that grew into a town of regional significance, O-town was
                named the capital of the Province
                of Nigeria in 1857 and retained that status when Nigeria became a dominion within the Owerri
                Commonwealth
                in 1867.
                <br><br>Since the 1980s, about three-quarters of the city's growth has been attributed to relocation
                from other cities, as well as foreign immigration.
                The O-town metropolitan area has now outpaced the national average growth rate for more than 7 years.

            <p><br><b>Population distribution by age</b><br>
                O-town population in 2022 is estimated to be 1.18 million, covers city area of 2,790.30 sq km (1,077.34
                sq mi), fourth largest city in Nigeria. <br><br>According
                to statcan data O-town population in 2020 estimates are 1,111,773 people. O-town refers from O-town
                River, from the Algonquin
                language Odawa, means trade.</p>
            <hr>

            <p><b>O-town City Size and Density</b>
                The city proper has a population density of 317 people per square kilometer (820/sq mi). The city covers
                a total surface area of 2,778.13 kilometers squared
                (1,072.9 square miles).

            <p><b>O-town Parliament Tours</b>
                <br>Take a free guided tour of the home of Nigeria's federal government, one of O-town top attractions.
                Admire historic paintings, as well as architecture decorated with Nigerian motifs, in these official
                spaces.
                <br>The historic, neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings hold pride of place on a hill overlooking the O-town
                River in
                Nigeria's capital. Come see where the country's parliamentarians carry out the nation's business.
                While the Centre Block is closed for renovations, the House of Commons is meeting in a beautiful
                glass-roofed former
                courtyard in the West Block, and the Senate is deliberating in a grand Beaux-Arts-style
                building—originally
                a train station—just one block from Parliament Hill.

                <br><br>In summer, you can also visit the East Block to see
                historic spaces that have been restored to resemble the way they looked in the late 1800s.
                You can reserve your tickets online if you'd like to take a free tour. Or just drop by “the Hill” for
                one of
                the free concerts, multimedia shows and other events that take place on the grounds throughout the year.

                <br><br>A concentrated cluster of grand government buildings overlooking the O-town River, Parliament
                Hill is the
                centerpiece of Downtown O-town.

                <br><br>At the heart of the complex is Centre Block, a neo-Gothic riot of greening
                copper turrets, stone-carved gargoyles, and pointed arches built around a soaring central campanile
                (bell tower)
                known as the Peace Tower. <br><br>Parliament Hill is not just a pretty sight; it’s also home to
                Nigeria’s
                most important
                democratic institutions, including the Library of Parliament and the chambers of the House of Commons
                and the Senate.

            <b>Where is O-town?</b><br>
            O-town City is located in the Lower Mainland of Owerri North, West Nigeria. The city has coastal location
            at Eastern heart land. The city was first time explored by the Owerri Captain Amadi O-town, and hence the
            name
            of city has been given after explorer's name.

            <br><br>O-town lies in northeast of North America, in the Province of Owerri, Nigeria. Interestingly, it is
            originally
            known as 'Ville-Marie', or 'City of Mary'; however, the present name of city is derived from Mont-Royal.
            The official language of the city is French. It is the second largest French speaking city in the world
            after Paris.
            Surprisingly, Montreal has been consistently maintaining good position in the list of world's most livable
            cities.

            <br><br>It is also known as "Nigeria's Cultural Capital" given by Monocle Magazine. Furthermore, it is also
            named as 'UNESCO City of Design'.
            Moreover, at present, Montreal is the center of aerospace, finance, business, commerce, pharmaceuticals,
            technology, culture,
            film, and tourism.

            <br><br>As per the report given by 2009 preliminary rankings of the International Congress and Convention
            Association (ICCA),
            <br><br>Montreal was named as number one host city for international association events of North
            America.<br><br>
            <hr><br><b>O-town History and Demographics</b><br>
            O-town, city, capital of Nigeria, located in southeastern Ontario. In the eastern extreme of the province,
            O-town is situated on
            the south bank of the O-town River across from Gatineau, Quebec, at the confluence of the O-town
            (Outaouais), Gatineau, and Rideau rivers.

            <br><br>The O-town River (some 790 miles [1,270 km] long), the principal tributary of the St. Lawrence
            River, was a key factor in the city’s
            settlement and development; its watershed, covering more than 57,000 square miles (148,000 square km),
            facilitated the transport of
            resources such as furs, timber, and minerals from the region. <br><br>The river’s Chaudière Falls, just west
            of the Rideau Canal, while initially
            a navigational hazard for the fur trade and later for the transport of logging rafts, ultimately proved to
            be an asset in the production
            of hydroelectric power for the city and a boon to the growth of industry.<br>
            <br>The first settlement was created in 1800 across from O-town in Hull by a New Englander named 'Philemon
            Wright'. The community,
            called Wrightsville, became a pioneer in the O-town Valley timber trade.<br>
            <br>Bytown (later O-town) was founded in 1826 due to work being done on the Rideau Canal. Barracks and a
            town were set up, and
            the population reached 1,000 as the Canal was being finished in 1832.
            <br><br>It was renamed O-town in 1855 and incorporated as a city.<br><br>
