                    <p>
                        Apple.com websit uses a great method of arranging
                        graphic elements by order of importance.
                        Visual hierarchy is a vital part of good design.
                        If everything on your page looks like it has the same
                        importance,
                        then nothing appears important. You need to use visual
                        cues to tell people what to pay attention to first,
                        second, third, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visual hierarchy affects what you look at and focus on
                        in a design,
                        whether it's an image, graphic design, or web design.
                        It's a key player
                        in ct (i.e., how information is organized and displayed
                        for easy understanding and navigation)
                        and can greatly impact the user experience (UX).

                        2pac.com website uses the alignment Principles of websit
                        design very well
                        Although alignment is typically overlooked,
                        without this tool a design would lack a sense of
                        direction,
                        unity, or organization. Alignment simply refers to how
                        elements are placed on a page.
                        Its purpose goes beyond organization,
                        it is vital for enhancing the overall visual appeal of a
                        design or page layout.

                        Designers take into consideration the way that people
                        naturally scan a page when creating a product.
                        Each type of alignment –left, right, centered, and
                        justified – all differ in how and when you use them.
                        In English-speaking countries, text is generally read
                        from the left to the right,
                        so left alignment is the most common. However, for
                        certain purposes –such as promotional,
                        decorative, or in smaller bodies of text –the other
                        types are strategically utilized.

                        hp.com uses proximity principle of web design
                        When designers move elements closer together or farther
                        apart,
                        they are employing the principle of proximity.
                        There are two major reasons why a designer would employ
                        proximity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proximity helps to create connections or deploy them.
                        When we view elements of design near each other within a
                        composition,
                        we perceive those elements as related. By placing
                        elements away from one another,
                        a designer is able to convey that there is no
                        relationship between them.
                        The relationship between elements creates relevancy,
                        organization, structure, and hierarchy.
